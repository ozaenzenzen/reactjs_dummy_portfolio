Able to break down concepts and communicatively to deliver objectivity into team progress. Handled threading process on image processing and face recognition in flutter, developed & deployed backend service, and I have worked with the implementation of machine learning models into mobile applications.`;

export const ABOUT_TEXT = `With 3 years of hands-on experience as a software engineer, I thrive on the challenge of turning complex problems into elegant solutions. My expertise spans a dynamic tech stack, including Flutter for creating captivating frontend mobile applications, Golang for building robust backend systems, and Python for pioneering developments in machine learning. Additionally, I have a solid foundation in OOP programming languages like Java and Kotlin, enhancing my versatility as an engineer.

In 2022, I proudly graduated with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science, specializing in the fascinating realm of Deep Learning. Throughout my academic journey, I maintained an outstanding GPA of 3.86, a testament to my commitment to excellence. My passion for innovation led me to embark on a remarkable thesis, where I implemented Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to identify Taekwondo Martial Arts Movement. This groundbreaking research has been recognized and accepted as a research paper by the prestigious Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).

In Taekwondo Martial Arts: Beyond the realm of technology, I immerse myself in the discipline of Taekwondo. As a dedicated practitioner with a black belt, I embrace the ethos of perseverance, respect, and continuous growth. My thesis project exemplifies my dedication to combining my passion for martial arts with my IT skill set to tackle real-world challenges.`;
