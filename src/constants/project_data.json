Let's see what's interesting bout this framework. \nThere are simple widget that I used such as container, row, and column. At the next level I try to costumize the widget. The \"Daily Meditations\" menu was using BoxDecoration widget. I need this widget to give an image to this container and also I want to give the radius of the corner of this container. Menu \"New Music\" is a carousel. I used ListView widget to build this carousel menu. How can I change the axis scroll of the that widget? It's simple, I just have to change the scroll direction. Build some widget into the children of the ListView widget. \n Yup, that's all from me. See you on the next frontend design.",

I used Cupertino Icons for this project because I was so curious about it. I think it looks cool when you have style of Apple's in your Android's. Widget Carousel of this project was the quite difficult to build. I used package from flutter named Carousel Slider. This package helps me to build the design.
