This is fullstack project of Fauzan Akmal Mahdi. 

I developed frontend mobile using flutter and backend using golang.

The purpose of this app is to manage vehicle maintenance logs and for further I will submit the app to Google Play Store.
User can control their vehicle maintenance logs, see expenses by log and chart, get notification for next maintenance by expected odo.

Some pacakges I've used include
- syncfusion_flutter_charts to display maintenance data logs and expense of users vehicles
- connectivity plus is to handle connectivity context of the users device
- dio as http client
- bloc as state management
- flutter_screenutil to set widget size by device size
- hive as local storage
- package_info_plus to get device info
