This is backend project of Fauzan Akmal Mahdi.

The project developed using Golang language, database used is MySql Phpmyadmin, and the library I've used like gin for http web framework and gorm to handle relational mapping service.

This service has notification features.

From the Account models, I've built endpoint service for all role users
- sign up account 
- sign in account
- get user data
in this service I haven't developed security like jwt token. So all service all vulnerable to security attacks.

From the Vehicle models, I've built endpoint service 
- get all vehicle
- create vehicle
- update vehilce data
- create log vehicle 
- get log vehicle
every action for create vehicle, update vehicle data, create log vehicle, will add notification to the table notification. But I don't add push notification service on this case, only add data to the table notification.

From the Notification models, I've built endpoint service  
- get notification
