This is an App Project of Fauzan Akmal Mahdi. 

This is an log application to add, update, and delete a profile. This application implements cloud firestore to keep the data.

There are some external packages I used to develop this application such as: cloud firestore to store the data. I used screenutil to handle the widget size of the application. For the page navigation I used Get package. Getx is very helpful package and easy to use. And I used google fonts as a font of the app. 
Flutter google fonts gave flexibility to set and try many font style family available. And I can choose the font I want to implement to the app font style or font famliy.

Also, to control the state management of this app I used flutter bloc state management. The best part of implements state management is when I set bloc consumer on the presentation or screen layers.
There are some state I have to defined like loading, error, success. And the events like add list, update list, and delete list.

There will be further development to this app such as improving clean architecture and memory management.
Thank you.
