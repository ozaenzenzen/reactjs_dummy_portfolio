This is machie learning project of Fauzan Akmal Mahdi.

I've developed deep learning method using Convolutinal Neural Network algorithms to identify Taekwondo movements based on image.

In Taekwondo, there is a demonstration of a series of movements called poomsae. Currently, judging in poomsae competitions is still done by humans. There is a Deep Learning method that can be used to make the image learning function more efficient and effective with the Convolutional Neural Network algorithm. 
The Convolutional Neural Network algorithm utilizes the convolution function to process input data in the form of images to be processed by the model so that classification can be done. 

This study uses image data in the form of 6 types of Taekwondo martial arts movements. 

This study compares the effect of the number of convolution layers, the number of hidden layers, and the use of dropout layers on increasing the accuracy of the test data. 
The results of the highest test data accuracy were obtained in the scenario of using 6 convolution layers, 3 hidden layers, and without a dropout layer of 61.28%. 

By using the Tensorflow library to create a convolutional network model, it is easy to integrate the model into an Android-based mobile application. 
Therefore, the researcher will implement the advantages of the Convolutional Neural Network algorithm to classify movements in Taekwondo martial arts through input data in the form of images into an Android-based mobile application.

I've published this research on IEEE Explore referring to this link https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10017502
