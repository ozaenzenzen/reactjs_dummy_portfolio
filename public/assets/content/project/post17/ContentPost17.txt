This is a mobile application project of Fauzan Akmal Mahdi. 

The purpose of this project is to finish my thesis (bachelor's degree) entitled Implementation of Convolutional Neural Network Algorithm for Android-Based Classification of Taekwondo Martial Arts.
The application has feature to identify taekwondo movement by image which can be taken using camera or from gallery. 

Before I develop the app, I develop the machine learning model using Convolutinal Neural Network model using python. I have implemented tensorflow into this application so it can run machine learning models.
With tensorflow lite the model can be used inside mobile application in offline mode (without active network). 

From the tech side, there are some pacakges I've used include:
- tensorflow lite to run machine learning models inside mobile app
- using flutter bloc as state management
- using get storage as local storage
- using firebase to implement remote config because I developed the app in limited scope of users and research purpose.
